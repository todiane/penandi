# Pen And I Publishing

I had a WordPress website setup to promote the paperback notebooks I sell on Amazon. When the hosting was due for renewal I decided to create a new site using Flask with a Bootstrap theme.
Now that it is complete (and I love how easy Flask is to use) I am wishing I had used Django because I have a ton of articles that I have written and it would have been easier to store them all in Django.

You can see the final result on Heroku https://penandi-c4b324047655.herokuapp.com/ (Use Ctrl + click to open in a new window) and at some point I will add my domain penandipublishing.co.uk to it.

<br>
It took me three days to complete because it is a fairly small site which is why I wanted to use Flask rather than Django. I was hoping to add a blog to it but will look at that at a later date.

I am happy with the result though. I used a Bootstrap template called [Modern Business Template](https://startbootstrap.com/template/modern-business).
